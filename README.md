I used a basic MVVM structure with hiltviewmodel, retrofit for api call and Kotlin Flows. Tried to maintain a clean arch.  I used dependency injection only to show it, of coursde it wasnt necessary. I have not done implementation for dark mode.
I didnt have time to add unit/android test and to add implementation for caching.
